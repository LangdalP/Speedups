# Speedups
This repository will contain examples of how you can speed up some programs in C++. I am planning on writing a series of articles on how to parallelize code using solutions such as MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, Cilk and SIMD (SSE/AVX), and the code used for these articles can be found here.

## Programs to speed up
Currently I am deciding on what type of code to parallelize. Atleast one program will be some form of image processing.
Other suggestions:
* A program creating Mandelbrot set images
* A sorting algorithm (e.g. parallel Quicksort)
* A simple web-server (but harder to profile performance)
